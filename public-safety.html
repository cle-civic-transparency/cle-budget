          <p class="text">Funding for Public Safety comes from The General Fund. The General Fund covers expenses for what we typically think a city does – Mayor, city council, police and more.
            </br></br> Specifically, the General Fund covers expenses for 11 departments which cover the following areas:

          <h3>What reforms are being asked for today?</h3>
          <p class="text">
            There are many organizations in Cleveland doing work around Defunding the Police, but we are focusing on 3 specific budget related asks from Black Spring Cle's 5 year plan.
            </br></br> Those asks are to reduce spending on police in Cuyahoga County by:
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <h3>15% decrease</br>by 2022</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <h3>25% decrease</br>by 2024</h3>
            </div>

              <h3>50% decrease</br>by 2026</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p> Black Spring Cle's plan also asks to redirect that money to fund other services such as free city-wide wifi, free public transit, free pre-trial services, a tax abatement for public housing and an East Side Trauma Clinic.
            </br> Below we have visualized where those cut funds could be redirects to me those goals.

          <div id="chart3"></div>
          <!-- <p>In the end the city would be funding RTA</p>

            <li>$1M to the Office of Sustainability</li>
            <li>$10M to Judicial Branch (potentially to set up free pre trial services)</li>
            <li>$10M to the Deparment of Public Works to increase the parks budget</li>
          </ul> -->
          <h3>What happens to the Division of Police Budget?</h3>
          <p>A <b>15%</b> decrease to the Division of Police means a cut of <b>~$31M.</b> That's <b>3x</b> the current Department of Health Budget!</p>
          <br>The Division of Police could meet those budget cuts by:
          <ul>
            <li>Cuting ~467 police officers. That would still leave 869 polices officers in the city.</li>
            <li>Cut the hospitalization cost in half and cut ~318 police officers. That would still leave over 1,000 officers in the city.</li>
