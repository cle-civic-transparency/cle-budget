          <p class="text">
          </br>Money for <u>Utilities</u> comes from the Major Enterprise Fund. The Major Enterprise Fund pays for the city's public utilities which includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Water</li>
              <li>Sewer</li>
              <li>Electricity (Cleveland Public Power)</li>
              <li>Airport</li>
            </ul>Unlike other funds that are paid for through tax dollars, the services in this fund are mostly paid for by user fees, such as when you pay your energy bill.
            </br></br>In times when user fees aren't enough to cover all expenses, some money is transferred from the General Fund.

            <!-- <b>Are we still on track to get to 15% by 2022?</b>
            <br>According to Cleveland Public Power, the following projects have recently received funding:
            <ul>
              <li>Quasar - Anaerobic digestion</li>
              <li>5 Hydro Plants</li>
              <li>A 4,200 Solar Panel Farm on E. 82nd & Kinsman</li>
              <li>3 Wind projects</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>2005- W/ Great Lakes Science Center</li>
                  <li>2012 - Blue Creek Wind Farm w/ American Municipal Power (AMP)</li>
                  <li>(In progress) - Icebreaker Wind w/ Lake Erie Energy development Corporation (LEEDCo)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            It is unclear how much has been spent on these projects thus far, but a rough calculation shows that combined they have been generating 81.7 MW, which is ~27% of Cleveland's Energy 300 MW usage. This mean Cleveland is on track for it's 25% goal, but does not have more in the pipeline to get us to 100%.

            <br><br><b>Utilities Shut-offs:</b>
            </br>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed many households at risk of losing access to basic utilities, compounding an already tenuous financial situation for lower income households. The city said there were 89,470 Cleveland Water customers behind on their utility bills with an average of $481.02 owed. As many as 28,545 Cleveland Public Power customers are behind on their monthly bills with an average amount of $281.39 owed.
          </br><br>Let's run some hypotheticals:
              <ul>
                <li>It would cost the city <b>$8M</b> to cover the utilities for the <b>28,545 people</b> in 2020 who were unable to afford their energy utilities due to COVID-19 and other financial insecurities.</li>
                <li> It would cost the city another <b>$43 M</b> to cover the water utilities for the 89,470 people unable to afford their water bill. </li>
                <li>114,000 households - approximately 30% of Cleveland’s current population - live below the poverty line. At an average cost of <b>$700 per household</b>, the City could cover the cost of utilities for a sum of approximately <b>$79.8 M per year</b>. That amount equates to <b>20%</b> of the current Public Safety budget.</li>
              </ul>
            Here are a few ideas for how, hypothetically, the city could pay for it:
              <ul>
                <li>Raise utility costs for households who make above $100,000 dollars</li>
                <li>Transfer money from other departments</li>
                <li>Create a rainy day fund for delinquent households</li>
              </ul>
            <b>Clean Water Infrastructure:</b>
          </br> Since utilities also include water, we also want to highlight the Cleveland Action Plans water goals. The city has set a goal of having the Cuyahoga River delisted as an area of concern by 2025.
          </br><br>Some of the most aggressive infrastructure projects comprise NEORSD’s Project Clean Lake which aims to capture and treat 98% of all stormwater. This project represents a $3 billion investment over the course of 25 years, with a planned completion in 2036.
          </br></br>Additional projects, such as the restoration of Doan Brook, represent a focus on green infrastructure. This, along with several other projects from local climate groups means the city is on track for hitting this goal.
          </br></br><b>Green Investment:</b>
          <br>Additional investment is underway to increase tree plantings throughout the city with an aim of restoring the city’s tree canopy. These aggressive goals are sometimes at odds with the City’s propensity to destroy or remove mature shade trees for utility work and sidewalk repair. Need links to initiatives (ward 15 tree program, something about the tree removal in recent years).
