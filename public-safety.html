          <p class="text">Funding for <b>public safety</b> comes from the General Fund. This fund covers expenses for what we typically think a city does – the mayor, city council, police and more.
            </br></br> Specifically, the General Fund covers expenses for 11 departments which cover the following areas:

        <h3>How has the Cleveland police budget changed over time?</h3>
        <p>
          The summer of 2020, protests all around America were happening asking to “Defund the Police.” The topic became a national focus, but still has many open questions. What does it mean to defund the police?
          </br></br>The graph below shows the size of the Department of Public Safety Budget since 2002.
        </p>
        <div class="svg" id="police-chart2"></div>
        <p> <span class="year">2004:</span> After years of budget deficits, Cleveland city government was finally forced to make budget cuts to the police department. From 2004 to 2015,the Police budget gradually decreased with 2015 marking a 19.2%
          decrease from 2004.</p>
        <p> <span class="year">2012:</span> Timothy Russel and Malissa were shot by the police 137 times.</p>
        <p> <span class="year">2014:</span> Tamir Rice, an unarmed 12-year-old with a toy gun, was fatally shot by the Cleveland police at close range in the Cudell Commons park, <b>less than a second</b> after the police arrived.</p>
        <p><span class="year">2016:</span> After several high profile shootings, the Federal Department of Justice issued a consent decree that increased the Department of Safety budget by ~$7.7 M each year.</p>
        <h3>Budget cuts did not always mean less employees.</h3>
        <div class="svg" id="police-chart3"></div>
        <p> <span class="year">2004: </span> Even though 2004 faced huge budget cuts, the number of Division of Police employees increased by 38.
          </br></br><span class="year">2006: </span> More budget cuts, but 55 employees were added.
          </br></br><span class="year">2017: </span> Even the Federal Department of Justice's consent decree included an employee increase. Between 2016 and 2017, the Division of Police increased by almost 100 employees.
        </p>
        <h3>How have other safety budgets fared in this same period?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fire has experienced a 23.4% decrease in full time staff since 2002, equating to a loss of 237 full time employees. The budget, adjusted for inflation, has experienced a 17.9% decrease over the same period.</li>
          <li>EMS has experienced a 17.3% increase in full time staff since 2002, equating to a gain of 49 full time staff. The budget, adjusted for inflation, has experienced a 31.2% increase over the same period.</li>
