            <ul>
              <li>15% reduction in total tax dollars spent on policing in Cuyahoga County. (Note - This reduction most closely resembles 2012 policing levels, which equate to a 11.2% decrease from 2020. A full 15% decrease would require an $8.2 M reduction from the 2012 levels of policing - an amount in line with what is currently spent on meeting consent decree requirements.)</li>
              <li>Public commitment from city officials in the 2021 election cycle to establish a pilot program to modify the dispatch system to direct non-police emergency services to non-violent 9-1-1 calls.</li>
              <li>Establishment of a permanent, elected civilian review board over the Cleveland Police Department with firing power over all officers.</li>
              <li>Construction of an East Side Trauma Center as paid for by the Cleveland Clinic and University's Hospitals</li>
              <li>Public comment at all city-council meetings</li>

            <ul>
              <li>25% Reduction in total tax dollars spent on policing in Cleveland. (This reduction equates to a Police budget of roughly $163.7 M per year - a budget that is still more than four times greater than 2020 funding levels for EMS.)</li>
              <li>Abolition of at least 3 commissioned police departments in Cuyahoga County</li>
              <li>Overhaul of dispatch methodologies to exclude police entirely from non-violent emergencies</li>
              <li>Pilot program established to respond to mental health, domestic violence, or substance abuse related calls</li>
              <li>Free city-wide WiFi</li>
              <li>Development of a Resident Community Investment committee for the City of Cleveland overseen exclusively by Cleveland residents</li>

            <ul>
              <li>A single, accountable force under democractic control by the public is responsible for policing in Cuyahoga County.</li>
              <li>50% reduction in total tax dollars spent on policing in Cleveland. (This reduction equates to a Police budget of roughly $109 M per year, bringing Police funding in line with what the Fire Department received in 2008 (adjusted for inflation).</li>

              ​​​​​​​<li>Solidification of pilot program into county safety budget to respond to mental health, domestic violence, and non-violent emergency calls. This codification shall not increase funding, but shift funding away from the Cleveland Police Department’s annual budget.</li>
              <li>Non-gated healthcare for all Cleveland residents, including access to abortions and reproductive health care</li>
              <li>Free Public Transit for all GCRTA buses and trains.</li>
